A launcher for Ungoogled Chromium (https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) that keeps things updated.

Note: This currently only works on MacOS and Python3


Versions are sourced (and downloaded) from:

https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/

There are 2 flags to choose from:

--Dev : This will update your installation from the Development branch of Ungoogled Chromium.

--Rel : This will update your installation from the Release branch of Ungoogled Chromium.

To Run:
1. Clone the Repo
2. Execute python3 UCLauncher.py --Rel


You can also do: chmod +x UCLauncher.py from Terminal, and then launch with : ./UCLauncher.py

This program currently assumes that you have Ungoogled Chromium installed already, and that it is in /Applications.


Thanks,
